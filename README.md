# Neuralknot

## Machine learning for knot theory

Some machine learning algorithms which try to get as much information out of a
knot diagram as possible. 

## numcrossings

Toy models just for testing purposes that count the number of crossings in knot
diagrams with up to eleven crossings. fullconv uses convolution/max pooling
layers on the whole image while blockconv first breaks the image into blocks (of
size 2x2, 4x4, 16x6 and 32x32) then uses convolution/max pooling layers on each
block seperately. blockconv can be trained to 100% accuracy (both on training
and validation data) in about 150 epochs using a dataset of about 10000 knots. 

## detectcrossings

Find all crossings in a knot diagram. This will enable counting the number of
crossings in knots with an arbitrary number of crossings rather than only
eleven.

## gaussencoder 

Use a recurrent neural network to read the Gauss code of a knot off a diagram.
simpleGRU first performs block convolution (as in numcrossings) then feeds the
results into GRU cells to build the Gauss code as a string

## Scripts

The ```knot_utils.py``` script parses Mathematica graphics objects generated by
the KnotAtlas mathematica package, and converts them to matplotlib. Also include
various ways of processing the knots and converting to datasets for the
different neural nets as described by ```python knot_utils.py -h```.
